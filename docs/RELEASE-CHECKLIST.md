# AgentControlPlane release checklist

This checklist defines the repeatable release path for v0.9.0 and later.

## Clean release worktree

Create a dedicated worktree from the intended base branch. Keep machine
configuration, API keys, relay keys, demo workspaces, and scratch files outside
the release commit.

```powershell
git status --short
npm.cmd ci
npm.cmd run verify
```

`npm run verify` is the required code gate. User-facing release prose also runs
through `copy_lint.py`.

## Build release assets

```powershell
npm.cmd run release:package
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\create-demo-video.ps1
npm.cmd run release:sha256 -- `
  dist\agent-control-plane-v0.9.0-windows.zip `
  dist\agent-control-plane-browser-companion-v0.9.0.zip `
  dist\agent-control-plane-v0.9.0-demo.mp4 `
  --output dist\SHA256SUMS
```

Expected assets:

- `agent-control-plane-v0.9.0-windows.zip`
- `agent-control-plane-browser-companion-v0.9.0.zip`
- `agent-control-plane-v0.9.0-demo.mp4`
- `SHA256SUMS`

The Windows archive contains tracked repository files under one versioned root
directory. The browser archive contains `manifest.json`, `src/`, and `popup/`.
ZIP entries use stable ordering and a fixed archive timestamp.

## Reproducibility checks

Run `npm run release:package` twice and compare SHA256 values. The two ZIP files
must keep identical hashes. Check the manifest from PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-Content dist\SHA256SUMS
Get-FileHash dist\*.zip -Algorithm SHA256
```

Extract the Windows archive into a temporary directory, then run:

```powershell
npm.cmd ci
npm.cmd run verify
npm.cmd run demo -- --help
```

Load the browser companion archive through Chrome's unpacked-extension flow and
run `npm run companion:check` from the source tree.

## GitHub publication

1. Merge the release pull request after CI succeeds.
2. Create the signed or annotated `v0.9.0` tag from the merged commit.
3. Publish the GitHub Release using `docs/releases/v0.9.0.md`.
4. Upload the four expected assets.
5. Download each uploaded asset and verify it against `SHA256SUMS`.
6. Open the release archive and run the documented demo help command.

## Recorded evidence

The v0.9.0 video presents the verified OpenCode run:

- task id: `c3aaa988-95a0-44ae-a646-090cd60ab105`
- executor: `opencode`
- model: `opencode/mimo-v2.5-free`
- terminal status: `completed`
- generated file: `.acp-demo\run-qLG0M9\hello.txt`
- verification: `true`
- reported usage: `10,148` tokens
